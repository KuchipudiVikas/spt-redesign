    question: "Bugs? Update Requests?",
    answer: `
    Of course some might encounter a bug or want something improved. The goal with all our tools is to constantly update them and make them the best possible tools possible. So please contact me (Corvin) immediately with any issues you are having or with some upgrade ideas.  You can private message me on Facebook directly, or email me. There will also be a form on the Coloring Book tool that you can fill out.

    question: "Why no refunds?",
    answer:
      "There are a few reasons. The first one is that you can preview the tool before buying it, and we strongly urge you to do that. Additionally we have included some screenshots on the information page. If you are left with any uncertainties or questions, we recommend not buying the tool and contacting us with your questions. I will also make a video about this tool, so you can see a lot of it before purchasing. Combined with the ability to preview, the screenshots and the video it should give you enough information to decide if this tool is right for you or not. Also keep in mind it will come with lifetime access as well as support. The other reason we are not going to offer refunds for this tool, is that there is a tremendous value that can be gotten from our coloring elements collection of over 5,000 elements that can be used to make unique coloring pages.",

    question: "Who will handle support / bug issues?",

  //   question: "Making puzzles vs Pages - FAQ",
  //   answer: `The puzzle tools will have the option to create an unlimited amount of puzzles / activities that you can download to one's computer. These will be downloaded as a zip folder with all individual puzzles (and solutions if applicable) in it. To make a unique high quality book one can either create the book with the downloaded individual puzzles with Canva by adding each item to pages in the sequence and quantity one wishes, or hire a freelancer to do it and send them the created puzzles and make a book with it.
  //       <br>
  //       <br>
  //       For possibly a limited time as part of the launch, there will be an early Beta release of another tool to help you make pages with those puzzles. This could be used with any of the 20 tools included with the bundle, but is just an additional tool included for free as a bonus while it is in early beta stages. This is not actually a feature / main part of the puzzle tools, and only an additional optional resource. In the future once it is out of Beta and fully functional for every tool, it will be released as a stand alone paid tool. Anyone that got Beta access as a free gift, will continue to have lifetime access to this feature. But most people will prefer simply downloading the individual puzzles / activities and making their own books fully customized in Canva or other design tools. `,

  "Our journey began many years ago when Cleo and I first began studying how to build websites and later learning Google SEO. Soon after that experience, we quickly launched our own Amazon FBA Product Photography company and began providing video production, photography for product listing creations, website design, and other services to Amazon sellers. We were quite successful at this and conducted countless product shoots for Amazon sellers.",
  "After assisting so many successful Amazon FBA sellers, we developed a serious case of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and made the decision to shut down our already flourishing firm, leave it all behind, and fully commit to doing Amazon FBA ourselves. After watching a lot of YouTube videos and having several friends who were successful online sellers help us, we felt confident enough to succeed. So, we introduced our first product, launched it, and it worked out amazingly well.",

  "In a rather competitive market, we rose to the top and, on some days, we were already selling hundreds of products daily. (Around 100–250 each day) We started rising in the rankings, passing some formidable rivals. Within a few weeks, we had made $50,000. We then produced a cookbook during this time to complement the Amazon FBA offering. The cookbook was very popular and briefly held the title of best seller.",

  "We then began developing our own self-publishing tools as the tools we were looking for, were nonexistent. We began by creating research tools, all of which are now available for free under “Self Publishing Titans.” We carried on by creating tools to create activity books and book interiors from scratch. We also started creating numerous tools over the last few years to create premium interiors and entire books with simplicity, speed, and ease. Many of those tools are also already available for free on my Self Publishing Titans website. More will be released in the future, and many of them are free, and some new tools not yet released will be paid ones.",

  "Cleo and I still publish actively and love what we do, and have found a system that works and is repeatable. We have now sold over 120,000 books. This is what we are teaching in this Masterclass. Everything we have learned and are doing.",
