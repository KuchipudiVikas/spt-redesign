And weight loss is just the beginning. Studies have shown that the keto diet stabilizes mood, raises energy levels, controls blood sugar, lowers blood pressure, improves cholesterol, and more. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, many people are intimidated by keto--they don&#39;t have a lot of time to cook, they have a whole family to feed, or they worry that they&#39;ll miss their favorite meals. That is why Maya Krampf created her now hugely popular website, Wholesome Yum, to share easy keto recipes all with ten ingredients or less. And now, in her first cookbook, Maya is determined to show people that a keto lifestyle does not have to be complicated, time-consuming, unsustainable, or boring. <br/></span><span class=\"a-text-italic\"><br/>The Wholesome Yum Easy Keto Cookbook</span><span> features 100 super-simple, I-can&#39;t-believe-that&#39;s-keto recipes including flourless chocolate chip peanut butter waffles, sheet pan sausage breakfast sandwiches, crispy keto chicken fingers, spaghetti squash ramen soup, keto garlic bread sticks, cinnamon roll pizza, and much more. You don&#39;t have to give up your favorite foods--virtually anything you like to eat can be made keto, and delectably so. The book also features a primer on the keto diet, essential pantry-stocking tips, and a section dedicated to creating Maya&#39;s signature &#34;fathead&#34; keto dough that is used to prepare delicious keto breads, pastries, tortillas, and more.</span>  </div> <div class=\"a-expander-header a-expander-partial-collapse-header\"><div class=\"a-expander-content-fade\"></div><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-declarative\" data-a-expander-toggle=\"{&#34;allowLinkDefault&#34;:true, &#34;expand_prompt&#34;:&#34;Read more&#34;, &#34;collapse_prompt&#34;:&#34;Read less&#34;}\"><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a></div> </div>                                 ",

But food is more than just nourishment; food is tradition, food is love, and most importantly, food is a celebration. <br/><br/>The mere thought of eating a particular meal or the smell of a favorite childhood dish can evoke positive memories, whether it’s a simple Sunday dinner with family or a major life event. When you begin following the ketogenic diet, whether your goal is to promote weight loss, improve blood markers, or just enhance overall health and well-being, it’s easy to forget to enjoy food. Some people fall into a drab routine of consuming the same dishes over and over, which can lead to boredom and frustration—and ultimately to the desire to fall back into old, poor eating habits. With </span><span class=\"a-text-italic\">Keto Comfort Foods</span><span>, Maria Emmerich reassures everyone on the keto diet that it isn’t difficult at all to recreate those favorite foods and meals in healthy ways—you just need to use a little creativity. By using clever low- or no-calorie substitutions for sugar and scrubbing all recipes clean of gluten-containing additives, Maria has created an incredible resource for comforting home-cooked meals that are safe enough for everyone in the family and delicious enough for the most discerning eaters. These recipes are sure to become new family favorites! <br/><br/>In </span><span class=\"a-text-italic\">Keto Comfort Foods</span><span>, Maria Emmerich has compiled her most soul-warming, happiness-invoking recipes. The book’s more than 170 tantalizing, hearty comfort food recipes include everything from cinnamon rolls to steak fries, and from chicken cordon bleu to tiramisu cheesecake. Maria has covered all the bases, giving you the recipes and tips you need to make delicious and healthy versions of your favorite dishes.</span>  </div> <div class=\"a-expander-header a-expander-partial-collapse-header\"><div class=\"a-expander-content-fade\"></div><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-a-expander-toggle\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-interaction-events=\"click\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-declarative\" data-a-expander-toggle=\"{&#34;allowLinkDefault&#34;:true, &#34;expand_prompt&#34;:&#34;Read more&#34;, &#34;collapse_prompt&#34;:&#34;Read less&#34;}\"><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"></i><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a></div> </div>                                 ",
